# `images` folder

This folder should only contain images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, etc...), a `image-urls.ts` file that exports a single URLs dictionary variable and a `index.tsx` file that exports a dictionary with all base images components.

You can organize this folder's subfolders in any manner you desire. This usually don't affect the project's architecture too much.
