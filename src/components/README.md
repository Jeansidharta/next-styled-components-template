# `components` folder

Contains all components that don't represent a page. It's separated in two sections:

- `layout`: Components that are related to a specific place in the page, and aren't really applicable anywhere else. Examples: footer, navbar, modals, etc...

- `reusable`: Components that are completely isolated from the application, and can be used anywhere, anytime. Examples: buttons, spinners, text-inputs, etc...

- `modals`: All modal components. They should be inside the `components` folder because they could potentially be open at any point in the project.
