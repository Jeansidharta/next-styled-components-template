# The `models` folder.

This folder should contain all typescript models of your data. The file structure of this folder is not supposed to be very rigid, but in general there will be a single file for each general group of models, that will export onde or more model types.

An example will be a file `user.ts` that exports the types `User` and `Administrator`.
